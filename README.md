<H1> About this Project</H1>

****************************************************************************************
<P> This is a research project created as part of my Junior High School internship. For this project, I researched different open-source security tools available and how they can be used for different business domains to protect data and company assets. I am very thankful to my mentor Mr. Rao Lakkakula for guiding me through this entire project and helping me learn something new in the Computer Science field.   

  This work can be used to learn about different open-source tools available for addressing specific types of vulnerabilities (weaknesses) as applicable for each business.
