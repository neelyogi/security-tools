<H1> About this Project</H1>

****************************************************************************************
<P> This is a research project created as part of my Junior High School internship. For this project, I researched different open-source security tools available and how they can be used for different business domains to protect data and company assets. I am very thankful to my mentor Mr. Rao Lakkakula for guiding me through this entire project and helping me learn something new in the Computer Science field.   

  This work can be used to learn about different open-source tools available for addressing specific types of vulnerabilities (weaknesses) as applicable to each business.

<H3>Importance of Security</H3> 
  <li> Cybersecurity is a crucial aspect of protecting businesses, organizations, and individuals </li>
  <li> This applies to all types of business and non-profit organizations </li>

   <li> On average, statistics have it that 71.1 million people become victims of cybercrimes every year!!</li>

****************************************************************************************

<H3> Role of opensource security tools</H3>
  <li> Security is an integral part of any business </li>
  <li> Requires specialized tools and knowledge to ensure they are implemented correctly. </li>
<li> There are a wide variety of open-source tools and technologies available to help. </li>
<li> Opensource solutions are a very popular option due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility. </li>
<li> Opensource security tools go through a lot of scrutiny and validation by industry experts making them a popular choice. </li>

****************************************************************************************

<H3>Security awareness - Get smarter, get safer</H3>
<li> The very first best protection is imparting awareness and education about security. </li>
<li> Everyone in the organization needs to understand the importance of security at all levels </li>
<li> There is a need to promote proactivate, smart behavior inorganizations in order to foster a security-conscious
culture. </li>
<li> There are several opensource security tools and resources available and suitable for individuals, Small and Medium Businesses, Schools/education institutions and non-profit organizations. </li>

****************************************************************************************

<H3> Cyber Security Tools for Small and Medium Businesses</H3>
<li> Small and medium business should consider adding security requirements as part of their products </li>
<li> If security is not considered, it can lead to vulnerabilities being exploited </li>
<li> If the vulnerabilities are exploited, it can lead to losing customer trust and also pay penalties </li>
<li> In addition to adding security as part of the product,they should always perform ongoing security testing to ensure they are always secure </li>
<li> Penetration testing and continuous security monitoring can help with ongoing security </li>

***************************************************************************************

<H3> Recommended Opensource security tools for small and medium business</H3>
<H4> Network scanning tools for network security </H4>
 <li> Nmap, Wireshark, Jok3r, Legion </li>
<H4> Web server security tools for webserver security </H5>
 <li> Zed Attack Proxy, Nikto, Wapiti, Wfuzz, W3af </li>
<H4> DB Security tools for protecting database </H4>
 <li> SqlMap and NoSQLMap </li>
<H4> Code Scanning tools to check the quality of the code and checks of security issues before it is
deployed into the server </H4>
 <li> SonarQube, Horusec </li>
<H4> Vulnerability assessment tools for ongoing security testing </H4>
 <li> OpenVas </li>
<H4> Intrusion for detection any anamolies. </H4>
 <li> OSSEC, Wazuh (HIDS) and Snort, Suricata and Zeek (NIDS) </li>
<H4> Security monitoring and logging tools to detect </H4>
 <li> Security Onion </li>

****************************************************************************************

<H3> Cybersecurity for school and education institutions and non-profit </H3>
<li> Like any business, security is very important for schools and education institutions and non-profit organizations </li>
<li> Along with protecting all other IT assets with network security and other tools education institutes need to protect the student information and their grades </li>
<li> For non-profit, protecting user information is very critical </li>
<li> Most of such information will be stored in Database. Hence database security is critical </li>
<H4> Even within the organization they need to protect the information only for people who need to know </H4>
 <li> In security it is called access based on ‘need to know’ basis </li>
 <li> This is achieved by having proper access control </li>

****************************************************************************************

<H3> Additional resource on security tools for school and education institutions </H3>
<li> The K12 Security Information eXchange (K12
SIX) is the only national non-profit organization solely dedicated to protecting the U.S. K-12 community—including school
districts, charter schools, private schools, and regional and state education agencies—from emerging cybersecurity threats. </li>
<li> It provides a list of resource library for security tools specifically targeted for colleges, and universities including brochures, banners and more. </li>
<li> It provides a curated list of recent information and resources to help US public K-12 school leaders and policymakers' direct cybersecurity and relate issues. </li>

****************************************************************************************

<H3> Extended list of Opensource
cybersecurity tools </H3>
<li> Security is required for every business, small or big, profit or non-profit or educational institute. </li>
<li> The specific business product may require some additional security with additional security tools </li>
<li> Depending on the type of the business and their risk, organization and businesses can choose different set of
opensource security tools </li>
<li> The subsequent slides provide the extended list of open-source security tools </li>
